# RateMyProfessor_Recommender
Language: C++, Python

Description: Developed a product that utilizes data from the popular site RateMyProfessor and compiles the data into an easier to sort/read format. Specifically, this project compares the time taken by a binary search tree data structure implementation and a hash table data structure implementation. It stores over at least 106,000 tuples of data on professors that work at the top universities throughout the United States. We even develop our own ranking system to adequately rank the effectiveness of the overall RateMyProfessor rating based on the number of reviews given.
